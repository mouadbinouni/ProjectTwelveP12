**Project Twelve (P12)** is a **GameFi ecosystem** designed to build sustainable gaming economies.  
We believe gaming is a core part of the Metaverse, and that **gamers and developers** are its most essential pillars.  

To put it into perspective:  
On **Steam**, the world’s largest digital distribution platform for PC games, players spent **38 billion+ hours** gaming in 2021 alone.

With Steam data, P12 aims to celebrate and reward the passion of both gamers and developers across the globe.
